This is old code I wrote in 2004 to learn Python and to make an IRC-bot to
play the game Werewolf since the only bot I found at the time required Java,
and I wasn't going to defile my server with any of stuff. ;)

Known bugs at the moment:
- Doesn't reload modules correctly
- Not PEP8 compliant, I'm working on this, my ideas of "style" has changed
  since 2004 and hopefully also my spelling. ;)
